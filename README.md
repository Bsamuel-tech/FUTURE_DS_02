# Project Description

The IPL analysis Dashboard provides an interactive and visually appearing way to analyze Indian Premier League (IPL)data. 
The project aims to demonstrate key data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, processing, modeling, and creating instiful visualizations. 
I used MS SQL Server for the data processing, and employed the power BI to design an attractive dashboad that provide insightiful information.

This project highlights various funtionalities of power BI, from importing raw data into MS SQL Server to generate meaningful reports through data modeling, DAX(Data Analysis expression)
calculations, and dynamics visualizations.

# Features
. Interactive dashboard showcasing key IPL metrics
. Import and processing of raw data from postgreSQL and MS SQL Server
. Data Cleaning and transformation using power query edit
. Data Modeling relationship building with power BI
. KPI design and calculation using DAX.
. Dynamic chart, filters, and slicers for better data exploration.

# Technology used 
. Microsoft power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation. 
. Microsoft SQL server: Used for data storage and processing
. DAX: For calcultions and creating custom measure in power BI
. Power Query Editor: For data cleaning and transformation.

# Installation
1. Clone the repo to your local computer
2. install power BI Desketop
3. Ensure you have access to Microsoft SQL Server to connect your data source.
4. open the power BI file and follow the instructions to connect to your data source.

# Steps
1. Import raw data into MS SQL Server.
2. Connect power BI to the database
3. import raw data from the MS SQL Server into power BI
4. Clean and processing the data using power query Editor
5. Building data model and create relationships between tables
6. use DAX for creating measures, KPIs, and Calculations
7. Design dynamic visualization using power BI's wide range of charts, slicers, and filters

# Usage
The dashboard allows users to:
.filter IPL data by teams, players, and seasons.
. View KPIs such as total run, Wickets, strick rates, and economy rates
. Explore various charts representing player and team performance
. Analyze data trends with dynamic charts, slicers, and filters

# Project Insights
. Team and individual player statistics
. Match performance breakdowns
. Insights into top performers based on runs, wickets, and more
. Filtering data by season, player, and team

# Skills Demonstration
. Data Import and Connection: Connected Power BI to MS SQL Server to import raw data
. Data Cleaning: Used Power Query Editor to clean and transform raw data, ensuring that it was in the right format for analysis
. Data Modeling: Created relationships between multiple data tables and performed data modeling to build a structured data model for analysis
. DAX: Used DAX for advanced calculations, including KPIs and measures such as total runs, strike rates, and wickets
. Visualization and Reporting: Created dynamic and interactive charts, slicers, and filters to allow for in-depth exploration of IPL data
. Dashboard Design: Designed an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard that presents key IPL statistics and insights in a clear and concise manner
